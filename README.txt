This is where I am going to call this dive into Flask. I have some other projects and topics I want to pursue at this time.
I learned a lot! It was interesting to see how a Javascript based framework like React differed from a Python based one. 

With Heroku no longer being free, I don't really feel like jumping through hoops or paying to host this site. Feel free to
run it youself if you so choose. Might return to the project at a later time to clean up my multitude of comments and look 
at deployment options. 

Skills used: Flask, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL
